## What is Regulus
Regulus is a starting rigid body physics engine written in Java. Regulus is in early development stages and should not be used for professional development right now. In it's current state, Regulus is unstable, does not perform very well and may come up with several bugs or even crashes. Currently, it only supports basic rigid body simulation and a few simple constraints. 

## Regulus in the future
In the future, Regulus will be a stable and
